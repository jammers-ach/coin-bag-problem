# coin-bag-problem

A stragner offers you a choice, one bag contains 6 kg of euros in coins, the other contains 10 kg of USD in coins.

The bags are not transparent, and are filled with random coins.

Which bag do you take?


## This project

The problem has been bothering me for a long time, so I wrote this simple python code that does that. 

The goal is to use the python to do some monte carlo simulations
